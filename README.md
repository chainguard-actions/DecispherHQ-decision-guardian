## What is Decision Guardian?

Engineering teams lose critical context when senior engineers leave, architectural decisions go undocumented, or new developers modify sensitive code without understanding the *why* behind it.

Decision Guardian solves this. You write decisions once in **simple Markdown files** — when a PR touches protected code, Decision Guardian **automatically surfaces the relevant context** as a PR comment or CLI output.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

- 🛡️ **Automatic Context Surfacing** — Posts PR comments when protected files change, grouped by severity (Critical, Warning, Info)
- 🎯 **Flexible Matching** — Glob patterns, regex, content matching, boolean logic (AND/OR), JSON path, line ranges
- ⚡ **Enterprise-Grade Performance** — Trie-based O(log n) lookup, handles 3,000+ file PRs, streaming mode
- 🔒 **Security-First** — ReDoS prevention, path traversal protection, Zod validation, VM sandboxed regex
- 🔄 **Smart Behavior** — Idempotent comments, self-healing duplicate cleanup, progressive truncation
- 💻 **CLI + GitHub Action** — Works locally, in any CI system (GitLab, Jenkins, CircleCI), or as a native GitHub Action
- 🔏 **Privacy-First Telemetry** — Opt-out with `DG_TELEMETRY=0`. No source code ever leaves your repo. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: GitHub Action

**1. Create a decision file** — `.decispher/decisions.md`:

```markdown
<!-- DECISION-DB-001 -->
## Decision: Database Choice for Billing

**Status**: Active  
**Date**: 2024-03-15  
**Severity**: Critical

**Files**:
- `src/db/pool.ts`
- `config/database.{yml,yaml}`

### Context

We chose Postgres over MongoDB because billing requires ACID compliance.
MongoDB doesn't guarantee consistency for financial transactions.

---
```

**2. Add workflow** — `.github/workflows/decision-guardian.yml`:

```yaml
name: Decision Guardian

on:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - uses: DecispherHQ/decision-guardian@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          decision_file: '.decispher/decisions.md'
          fail_on_critical: true
```

**3. Done!** — Open a PR modifying `src/db/pool.ts` → Decision Guardian comments with context from `DECISION-DB-001`.

> 📖 For production-ready configuration (concurrency, outputs, etc.), see the [full documentation](https://decision-guardian.decispher.com/docs).

---

### Option 2: CLI

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g decision-guardian

# Or use directly without installation
npx decision-guardian --help

# Check staged changes
decision-guardian check .decispher/decisions.md

# Check against a branch
decision-guardian check .decispher/decisions.md --branch main

# Auto-discover all decision files
decision-guardian checkall --fail-on-critical

# Initialize a new project with template
decision-guardian init --template security
```

**Use in any CI system** — GitLab, Jenkins, CircleCI, pre-commit hooks, and more. See [CLI docs](docs/cli/CLI.md).

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can it prevent merges?**  
A: Yes, when `fail_on_critical: true`. Admins can still override.

**Q: Works with monorepos?**  
A: Yes. Use path-specific patterns.

**Q: Works with private repos?**  
A: Yes. Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no code leaves your repo.

**Q: Difference vs CODEOWNERS?**  
A: CODEOWNERS assigns *who* reviews. Decision Guardian explains *why* it matters. Use both.

**Q: How do I skip for specific PRs?**  
A: Add a label condition:
```yaml
if: "!contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'skip-decisions')"
```

**Q: Other CI/CD platforms?**  
A: The CLI works everywhere (GitLab, Jenkins, etc.). Native PR commenting is GitHub Actions only.
